<h1>changelog</h1>
<br>
<h2>3.0 (unreleased)</h2>
<br>
<p>+ For Level Testing: press T to enter "Development Mode" when project is not running. Only some of the player's code is activated, so nothing else moves.
<p>+ Removed many, many, MANY useless obsolete blocks
<p>+ Buttons now make sounds when clicked
<p>+ Now my (and @redninjadudes) special skins are accessible to the public
<p>+ Added some easter eggs
<p>+ To preserve space, unnecessary sounds (like meows that Scratch puts in) were removed
<p>+ Removed God Feature (one level you can jump higher which never got implemented)
<p>+ Level layer issues by dragging level when editing 
<p>+ Ground pounds now set the Y velocity to 0 not -20 (This was added before version 3.0)
<p>+ Cheats! The button makes a reversed noice. (FYI: the cheats don't help, and are prone to crazy glitchyness)
<p>+ Some skins and hats
<p>+ Me and @redninjadudes can no longer drag the player
<p>+ Changed skin key to the B button
<p>+ Fixed water physics WASD not working right
<p>+ Holding K you can choose between 3 songs and muted
<p>+ Holding V you can change volume
<p>+ Starting music volume is 75%, not 100%
<p>+ Removed an useless level
<p>+ Removed an useless sprite, and replaced it for a level. Why? I don't you.
<p>+ Of course: LEVELS!
